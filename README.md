Project Reflection Report
Step1: Initially I have analyzed the components which are essential for the website.
Step2 : I have created 3 layouts (Home Page , About Page, Contact Page) using Figma.
Step3: And then for those layouts ,I have analyzed the essential components of bootstrap , and browsed the code snippets and the bootstrap classes essential to develop that layout .
Step-4: I have used 21.dev AI tool in developing the pages ,and some of the code snippets.
Step-5:I have created folders and added all the coded which are to be implemented for completing my task.
Challenges
•	The major challenge I faced was the time constraint , I wanted my layout to be User friendly and appealing to the user. So I had to face some time management issues.
•	Hero section creation worked all fine, but I have faced some issues while working with the navbar , as it was not responding properly.
•	Integrating the complete code and testing it responsiveness for mobile,tablet and desktop,took me a while as I have to change some of the components.
It took me about an hour to work with all the components mentioned above , and I have used AI agents Figma and 21.dev.
